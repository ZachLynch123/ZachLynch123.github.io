Cybersecurity refers to the practice of reducing cyber risk through the protection of the entire information technology (IT) infrastructure, including systems, applications, hardware, software, and data. Information security (InfoSec), or data security, is a chief component of cybersecurity and entails ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

Cybersecurity leverages a growing number of tools, methods and resources that help organizations and individuals alike increase their cyber-resilience, meaning the ability to prevent or withstand damaging security events. These adverse security events could include a cyberattack (via malware, external attacker, or malicious insider), a fault in an IT systems component or application, human error (i.e. a misconfiguration, or scripting/coding error), etc.

Enterprise cybersecurity practices traditionally fall within an overarching IT risk management framework.
