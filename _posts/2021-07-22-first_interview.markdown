First interview was for a Java development job out in Atlanta, Georgia. The interview itself went on without a hitch! I'm surprised actually on how lax and simple the interview process was with this company, dare I say it was even fun.
The interviewer was an interesting person whom had a lot to talk about not only with the company, but technology as a whole. Overall great experience, stil need to write my thank you letter.
