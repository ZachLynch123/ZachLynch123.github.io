GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

The biggest pro to using Graphql over other noSQL databases like it is that you can pull the information you need and ONLY the information you need. Often times with REST apis they give a lot of data, but most of that data is information the developer doesn't need. Backend engineers can make another api endpoint for the frontend engineer to send ONLY the information they need, but that can be tedious and time consuming. Graphql gives developers an option to grab their data ala carte. Very helpful.
