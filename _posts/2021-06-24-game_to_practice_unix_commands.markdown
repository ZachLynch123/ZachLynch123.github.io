Recently I found a game on sale called Hacknet. The premice of the game is that you're an annonymous hacker with multiple (fake) tools and go through various CTF-like tasks. The hacking wasn't realistic at all, but it doesn't have to be. The real fun and knowledge gain is from the terminal commands

The game simulates a Unix-based environment. Though it runs on windows; the game seemed to have accepted any and all unix commands I put in. It's a fun way to practice command line and a great way to get familiar with circumnavigating multiple file systems through terminal
