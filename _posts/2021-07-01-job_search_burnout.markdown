Identifying that you are burned out isn’t always easy. Is it the stress of looking for a job that’s causing the problems? Are you balancing your current job while trying to find a new one? Or, are you unemployed? It could be a variety of factors. Whatever is causing your job search burnout, it’s important to identify that you’re burned out, so you take the appropriate steps to successfully move forward.

Signs of job search burnout include:

Feeling overwhelmed or stressed by simple tasks. The thought of sending out another resume is overwhelming.
Poor health. This can be physical health or mental health, but poor health can be a sign of job search burnout. Maybe you aren’t sleeping well, or you’re getting sick more often. Or, you find yourself in a constant state of anxiety, worried about everyone and everything.
Irritable and frustrated. Are you irritated about other parts of your life besides your job search? Are you upset over little things that never used to bother you? These can be signs of increased stress levels and burnout.
Lack of social interaction. Are you avoiding social interaction because it’s too draining? A lack of social support or avoiding social gatherings can add to your stress.
